### HOW TO ESTABLISH A SIMILAR PROGRAM

It is essential that you start by defining your motivation. Why do you consider it important to have an open source program? How will it be beneficial to your company? What would you like to change? 

It is essential you don't spend too much time on this. Gaze into your company culture and you should find what you need. Listen to your people. Listen to people. Think!

Here’s the motivation we came up with:

* It is the right thing to do
* Our people need things they can be proud of 

Yeah, I’m sure we can agree that we did not over-engineer this step. The first statement should be self-evident, if you are considering a program like this. If you do not subscribe to the ideology at all, I suppose you’re reading this to get to know your enemies. Hi! 

The second statement might benefit of some background. The core business of Futurice is to develop and maintain digital services for customers. The emphasis lies strongly on the last two words. In project scope people can often find pride in what they are creating. Futurice has an open culture and is undeniably a very good place to work. However, this line of business, combined with our ambition in recruitment, results in a specific challenge. 

Futurice seeks and attracts ambitious and friendly people who want to be very good at what they do. Many of us dream of making the world a better place. Our daily project work may or may not allow us this luxury. Time outside the project work is quite limited. 

Our program attempts to address this challenge. 

### GOALS 

Program goals. MEASURABLE goals! The cornerstone of any sane company development, no exceptions. 

Or are there? Measuring the circumference of your head is trivial. Measuring the project team agile velocity using story points may not be easy, but it’s definitely doable. Measuring the effect of the chosen account strategy to company revenue and growth is difficult, but sure, you’ll get some numbers. 

Defining measurable goals for a program intrinsically abstract in nature is something you can spend endlessly hours on, ending up frustrated and giving up on the entire program. We got close to that point. 

Abstract? Since the generated base value (at least in the early stages of the program) is how people feel about their company, not to mention the philosophical argument of this “being the right thing to do”, getting statistically solid measurements can be an overbearing challenge. 

So we did not give up on the program, we gave up on goal measurability – for now: 

* People are interested, talk about and take part in the program 
* Real contributions are achieved with people new to OSS projects 
* Our people present stuff at relevant seminars and events 
* Recruitment sees our OSS awesomeness as an attraction factor 
* We challenge other companies to establish similar programs 
* Larger companies want our consultancy on OSS


Instead we agreed that we can spend this much time (read: money) on the program during the first six  months. If at the end of that period we cannot make a plausible argument on how at least some of these goals have been advanced, or present alternative acceptable goals that have, oh well. Bury the program. 

We are not saying that there couldn’t be proper measurable goals, just that we are unable to define them yet. Since we are exploring new territory here and we have a general agreement that the rewards may be  great, it makes sense to risk some limited amount of money. 

So we went with this:

* Effort estimate for 2014/H1: 60 work days + separately agreed extra expenses 

The 10 monthly work days cover the work of the core program team. On top of that there are plenty of  extra expenses, which are negotiated case by case. For these investments measurable goals may apply, eve with measurable return.

### MANAGEMENT 
A program like this will not succeed, if you try to run it as a clockwork project. You want to have organic development.
