      <h2></h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">This design framework details the process of designing social robots: from the problem space, to design guidelines, to the solution space. The framework has clear benefits for social robot design: providing a structured process for design, acting as a tool for co-designing in multidisciplinary teams, ensuring design decisions are explicitly made, incorporating users’ and experts’ insights, incorporating ethical considerations and incorporating ethical considerations into the design process. The framework can be used to design new robots, as well as analyze existing robots and their applicability to a specific problem.</p>

      <h2>Problem space</h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">Here the purpose of the robot is defined. Users can be e.g. a certain demographic, with specific characteristics and needs. The users’ goal is what they want to accomplish with the robot. Goals should be thought of in both short- and long-term perspectives. The robot’s task defines what the robot needs to accomplish with the user.

      <h2>Ethical guidelines</h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">6 general ethical considerations guide the interaction of the robot and the user:<br/><br/>
<strong>Physical safety:</strong> safe operation of the robot needs to be ensured, so that users don’t get hurt<br/>
<strong>Safety of data:</strong> user’s data needs to be kept private, especially in vulnerable contexts such as health care, child care, elder care and education<br/>
<strong>Correct behavior enforcement:</strong> the robot’s behavior can cause the user to behave in new ways, and these behaviors can spread to humans<br/>
<strong>Equality across users:</strong> the robot’s form or behavior should not exhibit sexist, racist, or other biased qualities<br/>
<strong>Transparency:</strong> the robot should indicate to the user how and why it is doing what it is doing on an appropriate level, in order for the user to be able to calibrate their trust in the robot<br/>
<strong>Emotional consideration:</strong> robots have been shown to evoke attachment from users, design can affect the level of attachment and perceived lifelikeness of the robot<br/>
</p>
<p class="othershortphrase">These considerations need to be taken into account in the specific context of the problem.</br><br/>

      <h2>Design guidelines</h2>

      <p class="othershortphrase">Design guidelines are to be formulated based on the problem space. Design guidelines can address specific needs of the users. They can be general, or specifically guide one of the solution space’s dimensions, which are explained next.

      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/frame/focus_solution.svg" alt="">

      <p class="othershortphrase">Decisions about the solution built with the robot are made in the solution space. The space has 4 dimensions: the robot’s environment, form, interaction, and behavior. All dimensions are interlinked and decisions made in one affect the others.

      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">The robot’s environment describes factors related to the robot’s operation context, defined by situational flow, human facilitation, number of simultaneous users and the role of the robot.</p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Situational flow</strong> describes how predefined the events leading up to and away from interaction with the robot are.
<strong>Human facilitation</strong> defines whether the end-users of the robot require the support of other people
<strong>Simultaneous users</strong> defines how many end-users can interact with the robot at once
<strong>Role of the robot</strong> describes the robot’s relationship to other people in the environment on two axes

      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">The form of the robot describes its external qualities: appearance, movement, voice, sounds, tactile sensations and olfactory sensations.</p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Form</strong> is measured on two axes. Its resemblance of human form is measured from anthropomorphic, to zoomorphic, to abstract. Its lifelikeness is measured from machine-like to lifelike.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Movement</strong> can range from machine-like to lifelike, and is defined by smoothness and familiarity of the movement arcs.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Voice</strong> can include things such as perceived gender and age, prosody, pitch, speed and human-likeness. 
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Sounds</strong> can be almost infinitely variable, such as music, animal noises, beeps, or human-like exclamations. The soundscape also includes sounds made by the robot’s machinery.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Tactile sensations</strong> should be especially considered in solutions where the user touches the robot: is it hard or soft? Is it cold or warm?
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Olfactory sensations</strong> are also important in close contact with the robot. Smells can be pleasant, neutral, or even induce disgust.

      <h2>Interaction</h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">The robot’s interaction defines how users can give input to its behavior through modalities, leadership and goals.</p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Modalities</strong> can be voice and sounds, movement and gestures, digital visuals, tactile interaction, facial interactions, or something novel.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Leadership</strong> describes whether the robot or the user is taking initiative in the interaction.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Goals</strong> of the interaction relate back to the goal of the user defined in the solution space. The goals can be to complete specific tasks, or explorative in that the goal is the interaction itself.</p>

      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p class="othershortphrase">The robot’s behavior is described by contextual adaptation, motivation, social awareness, and autonomy.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Contextual adaptation</strong> defines whether the robot adapts to its surroundings, or always behaves in the same “hard-coded” way in a given situation.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Motivation</strong> describes whether the robot has internal motivations, such as a built-in behavioral model, or responds purely to inputs from its environment.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Social awareness</strong> describes the robot’s ability to follow social norms such as acknowledging new people by asking their name, holding appropriate eye contact, and greeting.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">
<strong>Autonomy</strong> defines whether the robot operates autonomously, or if a human is controlling it.

      <p class="othershortphrase">This framework should be used as a discussion tool in multidisciplinary teams. It can be used to design a new robot, for a solution. To compare existing robots, these robots should be situated in the solution space, and then compared against each other to determine which would best fit the problem space that is being examined.
      </p>

      <p class="othershortphrase">The framework can be used as part of an iterative design process, with user feedback being gathered between each iteration:</p>
